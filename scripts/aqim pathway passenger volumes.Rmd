Third Rmd

-   Separate the WADS reference table for a column that identifies if the line item is passenger volume or intercepted material; see input\>data\>wads codes\>get wads codes.R; process those codes (started this process with WADS Lookup Codes.csv but I think I need to include more WADS codes)

    -   WADS for passenger volumes at each port

    -   WADS interceptions at each port

-   Produce a table with each identified combination that calculates:

    -   Port Code

    -   ASF item volume (volume \* rates for each combination)

        -   This is a single calculation - passenger volume at port X the total pathway-combination's rate,

    -   Interceptions of the combination

    -   Entry (volume - interceptions) of the combination

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
