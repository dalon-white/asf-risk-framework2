# The goal of this Rmd is to take any entry volume and multiple it by an already identified spatial layer

Spatial layers may come from `aqim pathway passenger layers.Rmd`

Volume come from `aqim pathway passenger volumes.Rmd`

-   by way of `aqim pathway approach rates.Rmd`

Fourth Rmd

-   Create a separate table that summarizes Entry values across port codes and multiplies by the total volume by the spatial layer's scaled value

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
